Plus7 plugin for Kodi/XBMC
================================

This plugin provides a simple list of available programs from the Plus7
web site, and allows you to stream them with Kodi/XBMC.

The content is only available with Australia, or you can apparently use sites
like Unblock-US, UnoTelly or Tunlr.net (free). or your own VPN solution which
terminates in with an AU IP address.

This addon relies on the mobile stream for iOS and Android. This used the HLS
stream, which requires HTTPS support, and should work on most platforms.

Installation
------------
First step is the grab the [repo ZIP file][download].

Simply download the ZIP file to your Kodi device and install through the menu via:

System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file.

The Kodi wiki has a good [walk-through guide to installing ZIP files][installzip] if you get stuck.

Once the repository ZIP file is installed, you can install the individual add-ons through the Kodi Add-on manager:

System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Catch-Up TV AU -> Select the add-on category -> Select the add-on -> Install

The Kodi wiki also has a nice guide on [installing Add-ons via the Add-on manager][addonmanager].

------
For any issues or bug reports, please file them on the [issues page][issues].
